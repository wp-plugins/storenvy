Get and display items from your Storenvy shop

== Description ==

This is a plugin for getting items from a Storenvy shop and displaying them. It gets the info from the 'products.json' feed, so only information that's in the feed can be pulled in to your page/post.
The plugin allows you to configure how the info is displayed.

The plugin has not been tested with anything prior to WordPress 3.0 (at least not recently)

Supports shorcodes and template tags.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `storenvy` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Find Settings > Storenvy
1. Enter your store's URL
1. Place [storenvy] in a page or post

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= [some feature] isn't working, what's up with that? =

This is definitely still in beta. While the plugin works for my tests, I need more feedback to try and get it to rock-solid status.
If you find something that doesn't work, **please let me know (trepmal (at) gmail (dot) com)** rather than just leaving poor feedback.

= The layout is screwy =

Try adding `div.se-item { clear:both; }`

Better yet, find some CSS tutorials so you can fully customize the layout.
